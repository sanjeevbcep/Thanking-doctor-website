            We grew up watching movies and superhero cartoons like Super Man, Spider Man, Bat Man etc. Even today many of my friends watches super hero movies, Marvel Studios are just on every bodies tongue. Although there is nothing wrong in watching movies and entertaining overselves but At the end of the day it's all fictional, Unfortunately they don't come to help us in reality... They are not helping us in this pendemic. But don't worry guys we have our own real life heros, They are Doctors, Farmers, Police, Soldiers, Cleaners and many more. They are working day and night to ensure we are safe, we are healthy and we have everything we need.

Not only this epidemic is about spreading of virus but also this has given rise to a lot of other serious problems like unemployment, fall of economy, Shortage of basic goods and a lot of other problems. Yes our heros are figthing aginst these problem but they also need our help. We have grown up listening "prevention is better than cure" from our elders, they say it they mean it. Lets fight against these problem by keeping ourselves, our family, our locality safe by following all the preventive measures. let's also help those peoples around us who need help. Surely The Sun Will Rise Again and this scary night will end:)
